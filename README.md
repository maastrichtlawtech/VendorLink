# VendorLink: A (Semi-)Supervised NLP approach for Identifying & Linking Vendor Migrants & Aliases on Darknet Markets
The anonymity on the Darknet allows vendors to stay undetected by using multiple vendor aliases or frequently migrating between markets. Consequently, illegal markets and their connections are challenging to uncover on the Darknet. To identify relationships between illegal markets and their vendors, we propose VendorLink, an NLP-based approach that examines writing patterns to verify, identify, and link unique vendor accounts across text advertisements (ads) on seven public Darknet markets. In contrast to existing literature, VendorLink utilizes the strength of supervised pre-training to perform closed-set vendor verification, open-set vendor identification, and low-resource domain adaption tasks. Altogether, our approach can help Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) make more informed decisions by verifying and identifying migrating vendors and their potential aliases with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both existing and emerging low-resource (LR) Darknet markets.

# Dataset
For reproducibility purposes, we conduct our analyses on publically available Darknet advertisements datasets from Alphabay, Dreams, Traderoute, Valhalla, and Berlusconi non-anonymous markets. All the datasets are hosted by IMPACT cyber trust portal and Kaggle. They can be downloaded through the links below:
